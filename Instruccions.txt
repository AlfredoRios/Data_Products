This application uses a generalized mixed model (binomial) to predict
the probability of injury or death (=personal damage) in the US due to Tornados. 
Data was obtained from the National Weather service and suplmented with the total US population to compute the probability of personal damage.

The app consists of one page divided in two sections the first section contains
a slider for months and a map. All the probabilities for states and months have been previously computed by a mixed binomial model, as the slider is changed the R code in the server selects all the probabilties for the states for the selected month. Therafter probabilties are pictured in a range of tones from white to dark red. Darker colors have highest probabilities of personal damage. The aim of this is to have a view of the spatial pattern of tornados. 

The second part of the app has two data input menus which allows the selection of STATES
and a third data input to select a month. Using the first menu STATE1 and the month
input button you can estimate the precise probability for a state(STATE1) in a particular month. Also you can get the relative risk of personal damage by selecting a different state in the STATE2 input menu.
